#+TITLE: Configuration files

This directory contains project /configuration/ files. 
For instance, if there is a set of paths that is always called when user start working on the project. In this project structure, files here are typically called in ~ignit~ files.

One example, I define a ~MATLAB~ function that is called by my project start-up function (see the [[./README.org][README]] file), to add the necessary functions to accessible paths of ~MATLAB~. 
Here is the example function:

#+BEGIN_SRC matlab :eval no :exports code
function srchpth = def_searchPath(projDirStruct)
% srchpth = def_searchPath(projDirStruct)
% content of this function is customized specificuly to a project (location)

cntr = 0;

%% basics 
cntr = cntr + 1; srchpth{cntr} = fullfile(... 
    projDirStruct.src, 'exptools', 'coreroutines');
cntr = cntr + 1; srchpth{cntr} = fullfile(... 
    projDirStruct.src, 'exptools', 'utils');
#+END_SRC
