#+TITLE: Notebooks

This directory contain all the notebooks (Ipython, org files, etc), that demonstrate the analysis and the corresponding results. 
They typically use the following naming convention:

~<number>_<analysis tag>_<brief name of the analysis>~

For example, ~111_anl_aesthValueIn1dim~. 
~analysis tag~ indicates the category of your analysis. 
For instance in the course of the analysis we simulate toy models (can be noted as ~stm~), we do parameter exploration (can be noted as ~pex~), etc. 
We also note these /abbreviations/ in the [[./ealog.org][log file]].
 
It's recommended to write a brief noted  (one-line summary) of the analysis and outcome in the [[./ealog.org][log file]] (why we did it and what we learn from it).
