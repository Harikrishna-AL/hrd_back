#+TITLE: State of the analysis
#+SUBTITLE: SoA

Every couple of exploratory analysis potentially lead to significant results that is typically suitable to be discussed with others (team, supervisor, etc).
They should be stored here with the following naming convention:

=<number>_<date>_<brief name summerising the content>=

For example, =5_20210823_hierachPersModel=.

They should have a relatively clean structure in a master file  (e.g., [[./5_20210823_hierachPersModel/msoanb.org][org file]])
that our future us can easily understand it the doc provide pointer to codes it generate it.
