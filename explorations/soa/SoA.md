# State of Analysis (SoA) of the project

We started the Homeostatic RL project in order to analyze the homeostatic behavior and neural activity of agents and compare that with the neural activity of the brain. We cloned and managed to run the basic two resource env where the agent has to maintain two internal states or resource levels (blue and red) within a certain range. The agent has to learn certain behaviors in order to maintain these levels and ultimately survive. The agent receives feedback on its internal state as a component of its reward. Certain interesting behaviors emerge based on the internal state. In this project we are focusing on the foraging behavior of the agent. 

## Experiments performed
- <b>Characterizing the Agent and Environment:</b> 
- <b>Connectivity analysis of the trained weights:</b> We plotted the connectivity matrix of multiple neurons as a heatmap to observe any patterns in the trained weights. 
- <b>Visual analysis of the agent's Behavior:</b> 
- <b>Neural activity analysis:</b> 
## Observations
- Connectivity analysis of the trained weights: 
    
- Visual analysis of the agent's Behavior: 

- Neural activity analysis:
